--  The MIPS-S Processor (Simulatable)
--		Last Release: 1st/June/2025
--	Authors: 
--		Ney Calazans / Fernando Moraes
--
--  01/11/2007 - Version with Separate Instruction and Data Memories
--  21/06/2010 (Ney Calazans) - Bug fixing:
-- 		- The mux that generates op1 now receives the contents of NPC 
--			and no longer the PC contents.
--  17/11/2010 (Ney Calazans) - Bug fixing:
--		1 - Decoding of BGEZ and BLEZ instructions were incomplete
--		2 - Defining which lines choose the register to write in
--			shift instructions SSLL, SLLV, SSRA, SRAV, SSRL e SRLV
--	01/06/2012 (Ney Calazans) 
--		- Version where the processor is now a single entity-architeture
--			(E/A) pair
--		- Minor changes in signal naming
--  19/11/2015 (Ney Calazans) 
--		- Changes to make the processor sensitive to a single clock 
--			edge, the rising one.
--		- Besides the obvious changes in memory component sensitivity
--			the point from where multiplier and divider take data also
--			changed. It now comes straight from the register bank read 
--			and no longer from the temporary R1 and R2 registers.
--		- Also the structure of the datapath and control unit changed
--			a bit. The Control unit now contains the PC, NPC and IR
--			registers and, naturally, it contains the interface to the 
--			instruction memory.
--		- The old Sidle state in the control FSM is no longer necessary
--			and was accordingly eliminated.
--  04/07/2016 (Ney Calazans)
-- 		- Several signal renaming produced to increase the code
-- 			readability.
-- 		- The name of the processor was changed to MIPS_S, standing for 
--			MIPS ISA Subset (ver annexed dcouemnetation, version 2.0 or
--			later).
--  05/07/2018 (Ney Calazans)
-- 		- Correction and adaptation of signal names to facilitate learning.
--  13/12/2018 (Ney Calazans)
-- 		- Eliminated any mention to an IMED temporary registrador, for
--			coherency reasons.
--  11/12/2019 (Ney) - Bug fixing:
--		- Corrected bug in M6 mux that appeared only when jump addresses 
--			had bits 25-21 differing from 00000. The bug was to pass R1 
--			to the op1 ALU input when computing a jump address for 
--			instructions J e JAL, and not the contents of NPC, which is
--			the correct value.
--  16/06/2020 (Ney) - Bug fixing (in the multiplier/divider modules):
--		- For some reason between today's version and that on 19/11/2015,
-- 			the multiplier/divider inputs went back to be connected to the
--			ouputs of R1 and R2 registers. This was undone.
--		- Another change was to alter the internal logic of the 
--			multiplier/divider modulos to enable reseting them at the same
--			time the procesor is reset. This required initializing 
--			registers RegP and RegB in both modules only when leaving the 
--			initialize state and not on entering it. After this modification,
--			it became simple making the modules reset signal a simple OR
--			of the processor reset and the uins.rst_md. The new signal
--			(the OR output wire) is called rst_muldiv.
--	29/09/2021 (Ney Calazans)
--		- Comments revised.
--	20/10/2021 (Ney Calazans)
--		- Comments revised.
--		- New labels added and identifier regnbits changed to reg32bits.
--		- The processor is now called MIPS_S everywhere, changing also the 
--			processor package to p_MIPS_S.
--	19/10/2022 (Ney Calazans)
-- 		- Several small changes were performed in port ordering, to make 
--			the simulatable and prototipable MIPS_S versions compatible.
--		- Some signal names were changed to English spelling, for
--			coherency reasons, especially in the multiplier and divider 
--			modules interface.
--	15/02/2025 (Ney Calazans) - Bug fixing:
--		- The software le_mars.c was corrected to generate a revised 
--			memory interface in the automatically generated memory.vhd
--		- Required corrections in MIPS_S and in MIPS_S_withBRAMs, to
--			correctly support single-byte read and write instructions
--			(LBU and SB)
--	25/03/2025 (Ney Calazans)
--		- Did some internal signal renaming in MIPS_S and added/enhanced
--			/corrected some comments, all to improve code readability.
--	11/04/2025 (Ney Calazans)
--		- MIPS_S E/A migrated to a separate file from MIPS_S_withBRAMs.
--		- The multiplication and division modules implementations are now
--			also in a separate file (mult_div.vhd).
--		- Alongtime, the MIPS_S (prototypable) implementation evolved
--			separately from the MIPS_Multi (simulatable) implementation.
--			This is very bad practice. A great effort was now made to 
--			merge both implementations into a single design, or to keep both
--			as only slightly different. At the moment, the single point 
--			that will be kept distinct (for now) is that the simulatable 
--			version will keep a single, bidirectional, external data bus,
--			while the prototypable version has two separated data buses,
--			data_in and data_out. There is not really a reason for not
--			making both interfaces identical, since the pin economy 
--			theoretically brought about by a bidirectional bus is not 
--			significant in embedded environments, and since FPGAs, the
--			common target Hw component have not abundant (if any) tristate
--			buffers, synthesis will produce internally multiplexed versions
--			of the data bus anyway. But for now this is the choice taken.
--		- It is assumed here that a basic processor system will have a 2-Kbyte
--			Instruction Memory (512 words starting at address 0x00400000) and
--			an 8-Kbyte Data Memory (byte addressable, assuming an interleaved
--			memory organization, starting at address 0x10010000). This is,
--			of course, easily changeable.
--      - Polarity of the bw signal changed to bw='1' for byte write;
--	25/04/2025 (Ney Calazans) 
--		- The validation of the 11/04/2025 simulatable version by simulation
--			entailed the need for a new modification/correction. The M8 mux 
--			had to be changed for MIPS_S_Sim, to adapt to the non-interleaved
--			memory organization modeling in its testbench. Now, there are two
--			alternative codings for M8, one for interleaved data memory
--			organizations and one for non-interleaved organizations.
--	29/04/2025 (Ney Calazans) 
--		- For coherence reasons, the old Ssalta state had its name changed to
--          Sjump.
--  05/05/2025 (Ney Calazans)
--      - To enable building straightforward input/output interfaces to
--          peripherals a new control signal input (suspend) was added to the 
--          MIPS_S interface. Also a new status output (suspend_ack) was 
--          included. The suspend/suspend_ack operation is as follows:
--          Whenever the control unit is at the Sfetch state, the active-high
--          suspend signal is tested. If it is active, the processor suspends
--          its operation (freezing at the Sfetch state), makes the 
--          active-high suspend_ack='1' and releases the data memory interface
--          for use by external peripherals. Whenever suspend is made 
--          inactive again, the processor resumes operation at the following
--          rising edge of the clock, fetching the instruction pointed by the
--          PC and deactivating the suspend_ack signal.
--      - The suspend_ack is registered to facilitate its synchronous test
--          by peripherals.
--	26/05/2025 (Ney Calazans)
--		- Comments part has been updated
--	1ro/06/2025 (Ney Calazans)
--		- Due to a warning from synthesis, we learned it is better to have
--			the basic 32-bit register definition (reg32bits) to use 
--			synchronous reset (to avoid BRAM corruption).
--		- The simulatable and prototypable versions were revised to become
--			the most similar the possible.
--	30/10/2025 (Ney Calazans)
--		- Several comments were enhanced.

-- 	22/11/2004 (Ney Calazans) - Bug fix:
--		- A subtle error was detected while executing instruction J.
-- 		- Remember that part of the job of executing J (the address 
--		computation), has been started before the ALU, displacing
